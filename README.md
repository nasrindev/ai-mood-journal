# 🧠 AI Mood Journal

## 🌈 Overview
**AI Mood Journal** is a smart journaling app built with **React Native + Expo** that helps users track their moods, write their thoughts, and receive instant **AI-powered emotional analysis**.  
This project combines simple design and the power of AI to support emotional awareness and mental well-being.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API
- **Build System:** EAS Build
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Choose your mood (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.)  
✅ Write your daily thoughts or journal entries  
✅ Receive instant **AI-based mood analysis** and supportive feedback  
✅ Clean and minimal UI design  
✅ Cross-platform support (Android & iOS)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user selects their **current mood**.  
2. They write thoughts or reflections for the day.  
3. The app sends the text to the **Gemini AI API**.  
4. AI analyzes the tone, mood, and context to provide supportive feedback.

## 🤖 How AI Helped in Development

Artificial Intelligence played a central role in both the **functionality** and **creation** of this project:

### 🧠 1. AI-Powered Mood Analysis
- Integrated **OpenAI API** to analyze user journal entries.
- The AI interprets text input, detects **emotional tone**, and provides supportive insights.
- Users receive empathetic feedback such as motivational quotes or calming suggestions based on sentiment.

### ⚙️ 2. AI-Assisted Development
- Used **ChatGPT** for generating boilerplate code, debugging errors, and refining React Native components.
- Prompts were used to quickly implement UI logic, navigation flow, and sentiment-based responses.
- AI also suggested better coding practices for managing states and handling asynchronous API calls.

### 🎨 3. Design & User Experience
- AI tools helped design a minimal, mood-soothing interface with gentle color schemes and calm typography.
- Generated content ideas for “happy,” “sad,” and “neutral” mood examples to improve user engagement.
- Enhanced UX copy (placeholder texts, button labels, prompts) for a more natural, positive feel.

### 🚀 4. Workflow Optimization
- AI was used to write documentation (like this README) and optimize environment setup files (`app.config.js`, `.env`).
- Helped troubleshoot Expo configuration and build issues faster during the coding sprint.

> 🪄 Overall, AI was both the **core engine** that powers emotion analysis  
> and a **coding companion** that accelerated development, design, and deployment.
